Description=Allied 1: Dead Garden
LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 1 - Operation: Dead Gardens@Location: Washington DC, United States@@Looks like we have fallen out of the frying pan into the fire. We are about to fall under control of PsiCorp forces - their attack was sudden and nobody had idea about the Psychic Dominator being constructed under the pavement of Washington DC nor about those in few other places around the world. Civilians left the city as soon as it was possible, especially those, who used to live near new PsiCorp basement. Capital looks like a city of ghosts now, although the evacuation did not allow us to move our forces and Soviet assailants which have also been taken over with the mind control powers of Yuri's device.@@Defeat of Yuri was not enough, PsiCorp hasn't been destroyed yet - their forces are swarming the United States and they must be stopped! Psychic Dominator must be destroyed or else America will become controlled by the PsiCorp and nothing will be possible to be done in order to stop it from taking over the world, even without their master. Agent Tanya will assist you in this operation.@@ Objective 1: Destroy the Psychic Dominator.@ Objective 2: Eliminate PsiCorp forces.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 2 - Operation: Curse@Location: Thebes, Egypt@@With the Psychic Dominator taken out from Washington DC, we have more time to plan an emergency movement neccessary due to the sudden attack of PsiCorp forces - we have received reports that Russia did not manage to protect themselves against unexpected technology PsiCorp introduced in their army - psychic illusion generators. It seems that Soviet countries are already under control of post-Yuri's army, even when their master is absent now and forever. It was a mistake not to deal with his force when we should have, but we still have possibility to correct that mistake.@@While you and Tanya have been leading operation in Washington, our secret force which hasn't been affected by Psychic Dominator yet by then informed us about increased activity of PsiCorp's special force called Scorpion Cell, detected near the Valley of Kings in Egypt which was noticed.. few good months ago! Shame we have never received any reports in time, but as far as our satelittes are right - there is a Scorpion Cell base indeed and it looks like the forces deployed there are being prepared for assault over Africa. While Soviet survivors are now being evacuated from their countries to the United States, we must not allow Scorpion Cellto take over resources of Africa and turn people there into mindless slaves or their mutant force. Enemy forces in Africa must be eliminated before it's power rises, as we must limit it's activity to Asia only.@@ Objective 1: Destroy all Slave Miners and the Grinder.@ Objective 2: Find and eliminate Scorpion Cell base.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 3 - Operation: Paranoiac@Location: Amazon Jungle, Brazil@@Commander, despite the fact that PsiCorp force in Africa is much weaker now and it will most likely no longer be able to continue expansion throughout the continent - we are still endangered. PsiCorp has Soviet force in their hands now, so even with Psychic Dominator not affecting the United States, enemy can easily take over control in Europe, as well as attack our country from Cuba as it seems to be influenced by powers of another Psychic Dominator deployed in the north of Brasil. While we are preparing for the salvation operation in Europe, we cannot let PsiCorp attack from the south and continue expansion of their force in South America. The device must be eliminated before the Cubans commence attack on the south of the United States.@@While at first sight the Psychic Dominator appears to be the most dangerous threat at the moment - it appears that PsiCorp has already incorporated Soviet nuclear program into their army structure. We have located two Nuclear Missile Silos just few miles away from our primary target - those must be destroyed before the mind-controlling weapon. Once you remove the threat from the south, we will be able to continue warfare movements in Europe and Asia. There is still a lot to do Commander.@@ Objective 1: Form a decent assault force.@ Objective 2: Destroy both Nuclear Missile Silos.@ Objective 3: Eliminate the Psychic Dominator.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 4 - Operation: Fire and Water@Location: Caribbean Sea@@Commander, though we have prevented PsiCorp from further colonisation into America and Africa, the threat may be bigger than we have expected!@@We have recently received reports from our headquaters, that Yuri has NOT been defeated by the Soviets! Despite the fact that they assured us that he had been trapped in time, it appears that he somehow managed to return and while you were fighting with Scorpion Cell, Yuri himself made a transmission to White House and introduced his return just like he did for the first time. His come back is definitely connected with the accident that has taken place year ago - Prof. Einstein's Time Machine, which has been designed for research purposes has been stolen from the secret base in San Fransisco. Well, after spying out what was available in now destroyed PsiCorp bases - it appears that Time Machine has been stolen by the PsiCorp in order to rescue Yuri. We have managed to locate it.@@The Time Machine along with another basement of PsiCorp is located on one of Caribbean islands - it couldn't be detected before, due to the stealth technology PsiCorp used. Now, when we know the general location thanks to files found in PsiCorp base in Brazil, the device must be eliminated! Prof. Einstein asked for this as he had realized how dangerous playing with time can be. Siege the islands with your fleet and then infiltrate them in order to find the device.@@ Objective 1: Find and destroy the Time Machine.@ Objective 2: Eliminate PsiCorp forces.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 5 - Operation: Plague@Location: Skaramagas Port, Greece@@Commander, before our assault on Time Machine took place, Epsilon started to infiltrate our bases within the continent and collect as much data as they could before they died. We managed to capture most of his spies but then, Yuri got aware that his spies can do more bad than good for Epsilon. He killed most of his unloyal minions, who talked too much. We managed to keep group of them alive, in Skaramagas - one of our most important bases in Greece, which was built after Soviet invasion over Greece during the previous Great War - but they are no longer safe there as Yuri knows their position. We must transport them to safe location and get more information before Yuri continues his plans. You'll get control over Skaramagas navy as the city is Greek most important military port. Be aware though, as Yuri used drastic methods to eliminate spies he already killed.@@When spies are evacuated, we'll inform you as soon as possible of what to do next in this battle against Epsilon.@@ Objective 1: Protect group of Yuri's spies.@ Objective 2: Escort spies to evacuation point.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 6 - Operation: Iron Curtain@Location: Polish/German border on Odra river@@Commander, after realizing how big his losses are, Yuri decided to withdraw most of his forces from the places where battles against us had taken place - they are probably operating in Russia now. @@We got some information from spies we captured in Skaramagas Port - we now know that their master was and still is going to commence a massive assault over the Europe starting with a naval assault - Skaramagas battle was the first episode of the attack. The next one is Germany - using most of his enslaved Soviet forces Yuri will try to break through German/Polish border and start expansion in Europe. We can't ignore this threat as when the Soviets were stationing in conquered countries, there was no possibility to harden the defense lines. Even when our European Allies have managed to deal with most of Yuri's mind-controlled forces, the worst is yet to come.@@We believe that Yuri is going to attack with Soviet brainwashed forces. Our satelitte systems have also located incoming forces - they will soon reach the border base which is the closest one to the Black Forest, where Prof. Einstein's lab used to be until Soviet forces destroyed it. Prof. Einstein is not ready for the evacuation yet as he is trying to collect most important plans of his projects and some of elements of the destroyed Chrono Sphere device, so the border must be protected at all costs!@@ Objective 1: Protect the border.@ Objective 2: Destroy Yuri's Soviet base near Germany.

LongDescription=Allied Nations - Mission 7 - Operation: Chrono Storm@Location: Moscow, USSR@@Commander, Yuri is surerly one piece of a megalomaniac - he has recently declared oneself to be the leader of the great worldwide army of Epsilon. Anyway, soon all his bases will belong to us. Thanks to your quick internvention in Germany, you allowed Prof. Einstein to be evacuated straight to Alaska where he's finishing his Chrono Sphere Device, which has been previously destroyed by the Soviet forces during the second Great War. The Chrono Sphere is now fully operational and so we can introduce the 'Chrono Storm' operation, which was supposed to abolish Romanov's reigme in Soviet Union, now against Yuri. We will commence full-scale assault into the heart of everything - Moscow, where Yuri operates in the Kremlin. Capturing him is the only effective way to stop his "Epsilon" from further activity.@@Before we transport our forces straight to Moscow, we must find a decent place for deployment. We have sent our special Navy SEAL team to sabotage Epsilon defenses established in the Red Square. Eliminate them, and as soon as the Chrono Sphere and our reinforcements are ready - we will teleport them straight to the Red Square. Moscow is free of mind-controlled Soviet forces, but we presume that Yuri didn't call all of them to attack during the assault at Germany. We will try to find them as soon as possible. Good luck.@@ Objective 1: Clear the area so Chrono Reinforcements can arrive.@ Objective 2: Eliminate Yuri's Elite Black Guard around the Kremlin.

While our forces are trying to locate Yuri somewhere in the world, it appears that the Soviets had own plans for the fight against Yuri and maybe even against us.@@The Soviets have somehow established a Psychic Amplifier in China, what allowed them to take control over the whole republic! With such power and after recapturing their homeland, the Soviets might be more dangerous than ever. We cannot let that happen, they can't defeat us again now, when we have such a chance for freedom. The device must be destroyed as soon as possible, before the Soviets manage to fully establish and command the army of Chinese.@@Before we transport our MCV there, we must eliminate Chinese Airforce by capturing the Airfields.

We have found Premier Romanov imprisoned in one of Epsilon camps in Russia, but he just moved from the cold prison on Siberia to a prison with better conditions in London. The Soviets have surrended and even sent us some reinforcements for the final battle against Yuri's legacy.@@Despite withdrawing it's forces from the falling Russia, the Epsilon was not able to prevent losses in it's army during the evacuation to Antarctica - it appears that the last active Epsilon fortress is located there. It is massive and well-protected but there is another trouble we will have to deal with - in it's middle there is some kind of huge tower built and it is even bigger than the Psychic Dominator. We don't know what it is capable of, but Prof. Einstein warned us that it may be Yuri's ultimate response to his dominators' failure. Whether it's just an enhanced mind control device or something more dangerous we don't know, but we must attack. Eliminate his base and eliminate his maniacal ego.@@ Objective 1: Destroy the Epsilon.

The attack on the capital was very sudden and we had no chances to deal with the enemy forces. Additionally, our units have encountered technology they have never seen before - tanks appearing suddenly out from nowhere and blasting everything aroung with energy rays. Nuclear Reactors have been sabotaged and without our radar systems working, division of stealth tanks surrounded the Kremlin and captured Romanov. Premier sent an order to retreat to Ural mountains before he was captured.@@Survived forces from Moscov are on their way to the support base 4-G in Ural mountains. Our spy planes have already detected small PsiCorps camps there, and we know that enemy is chasing our survivors. We have to reach the fort quickly and protect ourselves, at least here in Ural, before we contact armies in other countries and inform about the possible danger. In this case we may have to mobilize divisions stationing in occuppied Allied nations.@@ Objective 1: Reach the 4-G support base.@ Objective 2: Protect the fort.@ Objective 3: Destroy enemy forces.

Reports say that PsiCorp forces attacked the country in the same time they assaulted Moscow. And just like the most of Soviet nations, Libya has been conquered by post-Yuri's force.@@The worst thing is, that PsiCorp has somehow located Libyan nuclear facilities in the Sahara desert. Facilities have been captured and two Nuclear Missile Silos as well. We still don't know what does PsiCorp plan to, because their movements are nowhere near being random, but it is sure that the silos can't stay in their hands! As we are not able to recapture them, due to the massive force in Libya, the silos must be destroyed!@@ Objective 1: Eliminate two Nuclear Silos.@ Objective 2: Eliminate all Demolition Trucks.

LongDescription=USSR - Mission 3 - Operation: A Play Of Two@Location: Washington DC, USA@@Yes comrade, this is confirmed. PsiCorp has reconstructed Psychic Dominators and deployed three of them - one in Libya, one in Moscov and one in Washington. We still don't get how did you manage to escape from the Libyan one's influence, but this is not the best time to discuss it. The situation looks very bad. It must be said that we have been nearly defeated by the PsiCorp force, but if the Allies fall under control of Psychic Dominators, there will be no hope for recapturing the Kremlin and bringing Soviet Union back to it's glory.@@Once again we fight for the Allies' dirty business. We have sent Boris and Chitzkoi to Washington, to help you in this operation. Chitzkoi - the robotic hound who supported the first Great War cybernetic hero Volkov - has been recreated and upgraded by our sciencists so it can fully resist powers of the Dominator, as he is a machine, but Boris won't stay invulnerable to PsiCorp brainwasher for too long. You must act quickly or else Boris will be the other one who joins PsiCorp in the war for domination. You may encounter some resistance of mind-controlled Allied forces, but remember that Boris' gun and Chitzkoi's teeth are together the key to victory. Also remember, that both of them can resist basic mind-control tricks of PsiCorp.@@ Objective 1: Destroy the Psychic Dominator.@ Objective 2: Finish off PsiCorp forces.

Description=Soviet 4: Dragon Dance
LongDescription=USSR - Mission 4 - Operation: Dragon Dance - Location: China@@The worst has happened - Yuri seems not to be defeated and we have no idea how he could return from the warp trap. USSR has fallen - when you destroyed the Psychic Dominator in Washington, Yuri has deployed similar device in our homeland. We have no longer access to 4-G support base, but luckily, some of our forces have been moved to America. We must be careful of the Allies and their spies as even when we are in the alliance, we can't trust them. And don't ask us where our settlement is now. It's secret. Yuri's listening. Yuri has formed a massive divisioned army - the Epsilon. With it's forces spread across the globe, Yuri became a threat more dangerous than Soviet Union ever was. Except for America and Canada, the only independent country is China. We must create an alliance with our post-neighbour before Epsilon conquers it, because North America won't be invulnerable for Epsilon attacks forever. The problem is that after the first Great War, China is not so trustful to other countries and isolated itself from international cooperation. If Epsilon attacks, they will most probably try to protect their country on their own, they don't stand a chance against psychic forces and power of the Psychic Dominator. In the land of Xizang, we have once deployed a Psychic Amplifier during the second war against the Allies. Premier Romanov sent Yuri to China where he was supposed to construct a device able to mind control whole Chinese nation, so the warfare would not be needed. Yuri has never contacted us from there though, he vanished to appear months later with own army. What you have to do, is capture the Psychic Amplifier and activate it, so China will fall under our control. We are not able to do a fast assault on it from air though, because cargo planes can't reach Chinese air zone unnoticed, our special Spy Planes can and unlike the Chinese - we don't have a specialised air armada due to the restrictions we got after losing the first Great War. We have to strike quickly and sneakly.@@ Objective 1: Capture and power up the Psychic Amplifier.

LongDescription=USSR - Mission 5 - Operation: Red - Location: Beijing, China@@Luckily, we catched a squadron of Chinese Migs nearby so we were able to prevent Yuri from using nuclear missiles against our Psychic Amplifier. On the other hand, we now know that his forces are active in China as well, although in smaller amounts. Comrade, we did not intend to activate the Psychic Amplifier for men-power and terrain only. The Chinese can use such advanced technologies and powerful airforce that we started to wonder how came they didn't start any military movements - luckily for us though. You could see an example of their military during the assault over Yuri's Nuclear Silo - Chinese lead in airforce, they exceed even South Koreans as far as air technologies are concerned and this fact is very promising for us. After losing the first Great War, we were abolished to construct any aircrafts - that's why we had to trick the Allies with Kirov Airships. Now, when Yuri's Epsilon rise to power - there is no need to keep fullifying the treaty, but we are not able to create air armada on our own and neither we are able to explore new technologies. We have to implement Chinese military projects into our army. We have to infiltrate Chinese Military Headquaters in Beijing closer. You could say that with Psychic Amplifier there is no need to do this, as HQ are already under our control. Well, there still is a reason to send our forces to Beijing and that reason has a name - Yuri. He was quicker than us and his forces, which are naturally immune to powers of our Psychic Amplifier, captured the Headquaters building already. It must be recaptured. We need to know if there are other Chinese inventions that could help us in the war against Yuri. We sent Boris to the city, the North Koreans are also providing you with their forces which will arrive soon at the coast, which is closest to Military Headquaters.@@ Objective 1: Recapture and protect Military HQ.@ Objective 2: Destroy enemy forces.

With China under our control, Soviet technology has been successfully enriched with their very useful equipment. Once again, we managed to fully reconstruct our great airforce, due to the large number of Mig fighters Chinese have. Also, their completed researches on the electromagnetic waves and general electronics allowed them to invent such devices like Infector Tanks, which can easily immobilize enemy units, Emperor Tanks with few Hackers inside playing with the advanced mobile computer system which allows them to take over enemy structures and sole Hackers with their handy laptops, who can disable power in defense structures when deployed.@@In the Military Headquaters of Beijing, we have also found plans for a special superweapon Chinese were about to construct in danger of another world war - the Centurion Siege Crawler. According to documents found in the building, this machine is being constructed in one of special basements in Tibet, where also one of the primary Chinese airbases is located. Centurion is a huge mechanical robot, totally automatized - designed to fire massive cannonballs at great ranges. It's great armor and terrific weapon can be very useful in the war against Yuri. This walker can be the only way to siege the Kremlin without getting brainwashed and capture Yuri once and forever as it is something to be reckoned with.@@However, Yuri's Infiltrators are everywhere, and additionally - they are immune to the powers of our Psychic Amplifier.

Description=Epsilon 6: Jealousy
LongDescription=Epsilon Army - Mission 6 - Operation: Jealousy@Location: Carribean Sea@@The Soviet Russia shall no longer be named the Soviet one as it was completely dominated by my force - I have established a Psychic Dominator in Moscow. On the other hand, our progressive expansion starts to frighten the Allies. In case of too much losses, they commited a desperate movement and they recaptured one of our bases - unluckily, the one with the Time Machine my forces used in order to find me trapped in the Jurrassic age and bring me back. I assume that they are forming a special salvation force, so they can move it back to the past and fight with my weaker forces ratherthan fighting against an enemy who has almost total domination.@@We are in trouble comrade and so you are. If the Allies continue research upon our latest technologies and use them against us in the past - we may be defeated. Allied forces must be stopped.@@ Objective 1: Destroy the Time Machine.@ Objective 2: Destroy Allied forces.

Description=Epsilon 7: Frozen Candles
LongDescription=Epsilon Army - Mission 7 - Operation: Frozen Candles@Location: Alaska@@Comrade, we have found location trajectories of the Allied Chrono Sphere - it is located in Alaska. The documents attached to the secret plans found in Alamo said about the so called 'Chrono Storm' operation, which was supposed to be launched at Moscow in order to free Allied nations from Soviet dictatorship. As the Soviets destroyed the Chrono Sphere prototype in Black Forest in Germany, Einstein had to continue his work in the further and better defended location.@@The Psychic Dominator hasn't reached the last free American state, and as our secret weapon isn't ready yet - we have to react as soon as possible, before Allies prepare the chrono assault against our army. Though the Time Machine was destroyed, I presume that the emergency plan was to fight against our forces in these times in case of the Time Machine failure. Infiltrate the Allied Tech Center in order to locate the direct position of device using our Infiltrators but be warned, as Allied Defenders are everywhere and they can detect them. Then, take out the Chrono Sphere, and destroy Allied forces.@@ Objective 1: Infiltrate Allied Tech Center.@ Objective 2: Destroy Allied Chrono Sphere Device.@ Objective 3: Destroy Allied forces.

Description=Epsilon 8: Duality
LongDescription=Epsilon Army - Mission 8 - Operation: Duality@Location: North/South Korean border@@This is a wonderful day for the Epsilon comrade! With the Allied Chrono Sphere device destroyed, I can feel safer now again and keep my plans going further from the Kremlin which became a fortress which neither the Soviets nor Allies can break now. I had even more luck with locating a funny coexistence of Allied and Soviet forces which have not been corrupted by our psychic powers yet and yes it is in fact Korea. While the South one belongs to the Alliance, the North one joined the World Soviet Alliance few months ago, before the final strike of Epsilon. In spite of the fact that the Soviets have taken control over the Allies, Premier Romanov was preparing a support assault over the South Korea, which would help the North one to conquer it's neighbour. Although after our ambush this has never happened and both Allies and Soviets have coalised again - Koreas refused to. Don't bother with leading a massive assault over the Korea commander. Start the destructive conflict between neighbours, so we will ambush them from the inside and quickly deal with our last enemies as it appears that each of Koreas is preparing own battle against us. They don't want to ally, but they don't want to fight against each other anymore. Let's change the situation. And when you deal with this problem, the world will be ours to command and conquer!@@ Objective 1: Sabotage Allied Ore Purifier and Airforce Command Headquaters.@ Objective 2: Sabotage Soviet Iron Curtain Device and Nuclear Reactor.@ Objective 3: Destroy Allied and Soviet forces in their chaos.@ HINT - Try capturing some of enemy buildings in order to get more force.

Description=Epsilon 9: Rage Against Machine
LongDescription=Epsilon Army - Mission 9 - Operation: Rage Against Machine@Location: Tibet@@Comrade, despite the fact that the Allies have surrended, we got them under our control ultimately thanks to the Psychic Dominator established in Korea. This doesn't mean that we have finally won with Soviets though. It appears that some of their forces managed to escape from conquered countries and set up a secret basement in Tibet.@@Relying on the information our Infiltrators managed to aquire, the last Soviet fortress covers a secret weapon and the only hope for the world to break off our domination. In association with Chinese sciencists, the Soviets have created dangerous superweapon - the Centurion Siege Crawler - a huge walker armed with powerful cannon, which can resist our mind control and abolish my leadership conquering the Kremlin on it's own! We cannot let this happen! Eliminate the machine and see the hope of enslaved people burning in hell!  Lead the Epsilon to the ultimate domination Comrade, for once and forever!@@ Objective 1: Destroy the Centurion Siege Crawler.@ Objective 2: Destroy Soviet forces.
